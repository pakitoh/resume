## PROFILE
I am a software developer with 20 years of experience helping to create solutions for
different business sectors. A proactive team player always looking for a way to
improve. Agile advocate. I am eager to learn. Also experienced as team lead, mentor or
team builder. Interested in clean code, TDD and functional programming.

## OBJECTIVE
I have been developing software for the last few years and I am excited about the next
ones. I am now looking for a new challenge and I would like to find a remote technical
position that allows me to work on problem solving as part of a great team where I can
add value and learn.

## EDUCATION
 - Computer Science Engineering (5 years degree) - University of Seville.
 - Internet Applications And Web Services Development (250 hours) - University of
Seville.

## SKILLS
 - I am a polyglot developer with plenty of experience in the Java world and some
with Kotlin and JS. I also know a bit of Python and Clojure.
 - I have been around long enough to experiment different software methodologies
from the old Waterfall era to Scrum and Kanban approaches.
 - Well-versed on automated testing at different levels (unit, integration and
acceptance) and related practices like TDD and BDD.
 - I understand the concepts and benefits of applying techniques such as CI, CD and
those derived from DevOps culture.
 - Wide experience with different types of projects: from little internal tools to
big SaaS products deployed in AWS; from Java artifacts deployed on premises to
containers in the Cloud.
 - I try to help people around me to grow by providing honest and constructive
feedback. I disagree quite often but always in a friendly way and sometimes just
playing Devil’s advocate as I think is a great technique to refine ideas.
 - I am a good listener.

## LANGUAGES
 - Spanish: native speaker.
 - English: professional working proficiency.
 
## EXPERIENCE

### Lastminute.com (from 2022 to 2025)
I was hired as a senior developer for the team in charge of the flights + hotels search
flow using Java, Kotlin, Spring and Redis deploying on a Kubernetes cluster in AWS.

### Dexma (from 2021 to 2022)
As a senior developer I helped to build more data collectors and a new dashboard
component for sensor data using Kotlin, Java and Typescript.

### Piksel (from 2014 to 2021)
I worked as Tech Lead on the Piksel product from 2018 to 2021. My role was to support
and backup our Technical Architect and help the team (from 4 to 8 members) to provide
the best Metadata API for the product.  
Here are some interesting initiatives we were involved in:
 - Migrate the persistence layer off Datastax (Cassandra + Solr). The company
decided to migrate due to operational burden and cost and we had to develop an
equivalent solution using Kafka, Flink stream-processing, Postgres and DynamoDB.
 - We designed a new data partitioning mechanism to be able to create hot/cold views
of one client dataset and store them in different engines to optimize costs.

Before joining the Metadata team, I spent one year as Tech Lead in the OESP project for
Liberty Global, from 2017 to 2018. The project was a huge integration initiative using
Java and Spring to coordinate multiple third parties in the backend office.

From 2015 to 2017 I was Lead Developer for Channel 4 working on backend services. I
joined the team as a backup of the technical lead and was in charge of API management
layer using Apigee and OAuth. We supported the existing Java microservices and
developed new ones using a different architecture.

The previous one was my first year at Piksel. I was hired as Lead Developer in the Palm
project for Discovery Channel and stayed there from 2014 to 2015. Originally the
project involved the creation of a data pipeline using MuleESB to integrate data from
several external APIs to an existing system. Later the goal expanded to re-architect
that system too. This position was undoubtedly a big jump in my career: I moved from
companies exclusively offering professional services in the local market to an
international company working with big clients. And it was not only that, there was
also a big bump in people’s skills around me and the way of working.

### From 2005 to 2014
I started my professional career in 2005 and worked in several companies (Steria,
Telvent Interactiva, CICA) till 2014 mostly as a software developer in projects for the
public sector. I started as a junior developer and grew to more senior positions and
even led small teams (1-2 people). Java, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, Oracle and a lot of
XML in most of them with some SOAP web services or a bit of Geographical Information
Systems was the technical background in those years.
